                  A clone of a popular <a href="https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-creative/">Bootstrap Theme</a>.
                  Built using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery.  I learned a lot about Boostrap by building this page
                  and look forward to using in the future for other projects when necessary.

                  I built this page to see if a local fly shop would be interested in updating their outdated website.  Unfortunately the 
                  owner was not interested in updating at the time, however, I continued to develop the page for a fake fly shop. 
                  HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery were used here.

                  This project was a ton of fun!  A "hub" for Twitch if you will.  Using the Twitch API to call information about a predefined 
                  list of viewers you can see who is offline/online (and the game they are playing), as well as watch the stream from the page 
                  itself.  Built using HTML, CSS and jQuery, AJAX.

                  Epok is a time management tool that tracks the amount of time you spend on a particular task.  I came up with the idea during my
                  my time at Garmin, and thought it would make for a good tool to use for outside of work as well.  I enjoyed building Epok
                  because it uses vanilla JavaScript and learned a lot about JS along the way.

                  This implementation of a calulator was a rewarding challenge! This project helped me learn a lot about events and
                  working with the DOM as well as some other programming principles.  I tried to take the design and make it look as much like a 
                  calculator as possible.  A fun and rewarding project!  Built with Vanilla JS.

                  The classic game we all know and love, Simon.  This project was a blast to build.  Again, built with vanilla 
                  JavaScript, I tried to imitate the 80's game with this implementation.  Fun to build with both the CSS and the JavaScript.  
                  Do you think you can beat it?
